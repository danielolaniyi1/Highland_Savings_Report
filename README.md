# Highland_Savings_Bank_Report

## Project background
Highland Savings, a South African-based bank, is planning to introduce a new line of credit cards to deepen its engagement in the financial market. The basis for this analysis is rooted in examining Highland Savings’ customer spending habits, the payment methods utilized during transactions, expenditure patterns, and determining whether launching this new credit line is the optimal next step.

To support this initiative, I have been provided with a subset of the bank's customer data. This dataset includes transaction histories, demographic details, payment preferences, and expenditure trends. The data serves as the foundation for conducting a preliminary analysis aimed at uncovering actionable insights. These insights will inform decision-making and provide a clearer understanding of customer segments most likely to adopt the new credit card product. 
This report is directed at Highland Savings' high-level executives as part of strategic discussions to evaluate the potential benefits or drawbacks of the proposed credit card line.

## Report Objectives
#### Client Profiling
Investigate the likelihood of credit card adoption among clients across various demographic and categorical segments. This includes identifying trends and behaviors that influence credit card usage.

#### Category Insights
Perform an in-depth analysis of spending habits and their correlation with key demographic factors such as occupation, gender, city, and marital status. This analysis will highlight patterns and relationships essential for targeted credit card marketing strategies.

#### Strategic Recommendations
Develop actionable recommendations for the implementation of the new credit card line. These recommendations will be based on data-driven insights and will aim to maximize customer engagement, card utilization, and profitability for Highland Savings.

### Executive Summary
This report investigates the potential usage and target demographics for Highland Savings' proposed new line of credit cards. A high-level overview of the findings reveals that the primary target Customer Profile for credit card usage consists of married men, aged 35-45, employed as salaried IT professionals. Aberdeen emerges as the city with the highest credit card utilization, followed closely by Pretoria. Bill payment is the most common transaction type for credit card users, with significant usage metrics aligning with specific demographic and occupational profiles.

The analysis is based on a dataset of 4,000 customers sampled from all branches, comprising 2,597 males and 1,403 females. Customers were segmented into four age groups: 21-24, 25-34, 35-45, and 45 and above. The income utilization percentage—a critical metric used to assess credit card adoption—was calculated by dividing average income expenditure by average income. Higher utilization percentages indicate a greater likelihood of credit card usage. The overall income utilization percentage across the dataset stands at 42.82%, but this figure varies significantly across demographic dimensions.

#### Key Findings

Demographic Insights
The income utilization percentage for the entire client base stands at 42.82%. However, this figure varies significantly across demographic dimensions:
- The 35-45 age group exhibited the highest utilization percentage at 46.72%.
- Salaried IT employees across all regions account for 21.2% of the credit card usage.
- Married males within the 35-45 age group, located in Aberdeen, have the highest income utilization percentage at 71.57%, with a total expenditure of $17 million and a credit card utilization rate of 28.4%.

Geographic Insights
- Aberdeen has the highest credit card usage at 20.8%, followed by Pretoria at 19.8%.
- The combined utilization of Aberdeen and Pretoria underscores their importance as key markets for credit card adoption.
Payment Method Insights
- Across all customers, credit card payments accounted for 17.45% of total transactions, debit card payments for 9.46%, UPI payments for 11.46%, and net banking for 4.37%. The focus of this analysis is credit card payments, with an emphasis on increasing their share through targeted strategies.

Age Group Dynamics
While the 35-45 age group leads in overall income utilization, the 25-34 age group demonstrates a higher credit card utilization percentage at 20.4%, compared to 18.1% for the 35-45 group. This suggests a strong potential for targeting the 25-34 age demographic in addition to the primary focus on 35-45-year-olds.



### Recommendations
Efforts to launch and promote the new credit card line should be directed at the following demographics:

1. Married males aged 35-45, employed as salaried IT professionals, particularly those located in Aberdeen and Pretoria.
2. Customers in the 25-34 age group due to their higher credit card utilization rates, despite slightly lower overall income utilization percentages.
3. Tailored incentives such as cashback on bill payments and rewards for high-value transactions.
4. Product design features that cater to IT professionals, such as integration with digital wallets and enhanced online transaction security.
